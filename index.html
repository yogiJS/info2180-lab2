                Finally! The day has arrived for our family’s day at the beach.
                 My parents have been planning our family excursion to the beach ever since the summer holidays had started.

                 Of course, I’ve been very elated when my parents had made the announcement that we were going to the beach this Sunday coming. 
                 So last Friday evening, my dad took some time off early from work so that he, mom and I can go to the grocery store and purchase everything that we are going to need on our trip to the beach on Sunday.
                There were so many things that we had bought for our family day at the beach, like snacks and refreshments and meats and rice and so the list goes on.
                Now that the day had finally arrived, I was ready to spend a wonderful time with my parents at the beach.
                On Sunday morning, my mom and dad had been busy cooking the food in the kitchen while I helped packed the refreshments in a large cooler box with ice.

                Three weeks back, when I went in search of a ‘Goat’ to a quaint hill station, called the ‘Lansdowne’ little did I know that I won’t get to see either of the two, neither the goat nor the hill-station.
                <img class = hike src= "hike.jpg" alt = "Beachside"/>
                While starting from the Country Capital by train on a seven hour-long journey, I formed various images of this hill-station and the story related to Garhwal Rifles and it’s mascot ‘the goat’, there.
                But instead of salubrious weather and pristine environment I was greeted by the scorching heat, April turned out to be the cruellest month, even on the hills. 
                The picturesque and plush landscape did not welcome us , but instead, the monster sized water tankers covering almost the entire roads of the hilly terrain greeted us, they were lined-up for their turns to fill up, that too, from the water coming out of the natural streams.
                All this was to, cater the hotel industry.
                Yes the natural water resources here are being used to an extent , till they are depleted and the human hunger and greed has filled to the brim but still want more.
